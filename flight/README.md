# Flight Script

### Description

This script allows your character to "fly" in any game. You will need a seperate noclip script if you wish to fly freely.

* Some anticheat may detect this, use at your own risk! *

# Instructions

Copy and paste the contents of [`script.lua`](https://github.com/cheatxrbx/Exploits/blob/main/flight/script.lua) into your executor and press `execute`.
Once it has been executed, press `F` to start/stop flying. If it does not work, press `F9` to open console.
If the text `Script has been activated!` does not appear, the script wasn't executed correctly or your executor may be patched.
