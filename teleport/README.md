# Teleportation Script

### Description

This script allows you to teleport to any player in the server if you know their username.

# Instructions

Copy and paste the contents of [`script.lua`](https://github.com/cheatxrbx/Exploits/blob/main/teleport/script.lua) into your executor and reaplce the value of
```lua
local target = "NAME"
```
to the username of the player you want to teleport to. Once you make sure the string is correct, press execute.
If you do not teleport to the user, double-check your spelling. If it still won't work, either the game has an anticheat that protects that or your executor may be
patched.
